 * Services Layer - Business logic orchestration

 * Architecture:
 * - Contracts (client.adt.*) = granular HTTP operations
 * - Services (client.services.*) = business logic orchestration
 * - ADK = object-focused logic (client-agnostic)
 * 
 * Services bridge contracts and provide higher-level operations
 * that CLI and SDK consumers need.
