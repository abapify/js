# Ignore scripts directory from Nx source file analysis
# This prevents scripts that import workspace packages from creating

# Ignore e2e tests at root level (they have their own project)

# NOTE: Do NOT ignore *.config.ts files here!
# The nx-tsdown and nx-vitest plugins need to detect tsdown.config.ts and vitest.config.ts
# False circular dependencies from config imports are handled via namedInputs in nx.json
