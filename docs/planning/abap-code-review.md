# ABAP Code Review CI/CD Pipeline - Project Plan

**Specification Reference**: `/specs/cicd/abap-cicd-pipeline.md`  
**GitHub Project**: https://github.com/orgs/abapify/projects/3  
**Epic Issue**: [#2](https://github.com/abapify/js/issues/2)

## Project Overview

Implement a complete CI/CD pipeline for ABAP code review using transport requests as the unit of change. The pipeline provides automated quality checks, delta analysis, and comprehensive reporting for ABAP development workflows.

## Current Status: Planning Complete ‚úÖ

- [x] Specifications created
- [x] GitHub issues created with detailed requirements
- [x] Label-based tracking system implemented
- [ ] Implementation phase

### üîÑ Ready for Implementation

- **[#3] Transport Import Stage** - Extract and serialize transport objects
  - Status: `status:ready`
  - Dependencies: ADT CLI auth, ADK adapters, OAT format
  - Estimated effort: 2-3 days
- **[#4] Quality Check Stage** - ATC integration with multi-platform output
  - Status: `status:ready`
  - Dependencies: Transport import, ATC API integration
  - Estimated effort: 3-4 days
- **[#5] Reporting Stage** - Comprehensive summary generation
  - Status: `status:ready`
  - Dependencies: Transport import, Quality check results
  - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

### üìã Backlog

- **[#7] CI/CD Platform Templates** - Integration templates for major platforms

  - Status: `status:backlog`
  - Dependencies: Core pipeline stages
  - Estimated effort: 1-2 days

- **[#6] Delta Analysis Stage** - Change impact analysis (Future)
  - Status: `status:backlog`
  - Dependencies: Transport import, historical data
  - Estimated effort: 4-5 days

### ‚úÖ Completed

- Epic planning and specification creation
- GitHub project setup
- Issue creation and labeling

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1: Core Pipeline** (Issues #3, #4, #5)
   - Transport Import ‚Üí Quality Check ‚Üí Reporting
   - End-to-end basic functionality
2. **Phase 2: Platform Integration** (Issue #7)
   - CI/CD templates for GitLab, GitHub, Azure DevOps, Jenkins
   - Documentation and examples
3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Issue #6)
   - Delta analysis and change impact assessment
   - Advanced reporting capabilities

## Dependencies & Risks

### Technical Dependencies

- ADT CLI authentication system (‚úÖ exists)
- ADK object adapters (‚úÖ exists)
- OAT format specification (‚úÖ exists)
- ATC API integration (‚ùì needs investigation)

### Risks

- ATC API complexity and rate limits
- SAP system connectivity requirements
- Performance with large transports
- CI/CD platform compatibility variations

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Complete transport import with OAT output
- [ ] ATC integration with GitLab Code Quality format
- [ ] Markdown report generation with quality metrics
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline execution < 5 minutes for typical transport
- [ ] Integration templates for 4+ CI/CD platforms

## Next Steps

1. Start with Issue #3 (Transport Import Stage)
2. Implement basic ADT API integration for transport object retrieval
3. Add ADK integration for type-safe serialization
4. Create OAT format output generation
5. Move to Quality Check Stage (Issue #4)

## Notes

- Following specification-driven development approach
- All changes must align with existing specifications
- GitHub issue labels track progress: `status:ready` ‚Üí `status:in-progress` ‚Üí `status:review` ‚Üí `status:done`
