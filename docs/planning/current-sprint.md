# Current Sprint - ABAP Code Review Pipeline

**Sprint Goal**: Establish project foundation and begin core pipeline implementation

## Active Tasks

### ✅ Recently Completed

- **ADT CLI Decoupling** - Split ADT CLI into CLI + Client components ✅ COMPLETED

  - ✅ Created new @abapify/adt-client package with complete service layer architecture
  - ✅ Extracted and refactored connection logic (AuthManager, ConnectionManager, SessionManager)
  - ✅ Implemented high-level service abstractions (ObjectService, SearchService, TransportService, SystemService)
  - ✅ Updated ADT CLI to use new AdtClient instead of direct connection handling
  - ✅ Both packages successfully build and integrate
  - ✅ Plugin architecture updates completed

- **ADT CLI Logging System Refactoring** - Unified logging architecture ✅ COMPLETED (Jan 9, 2025)

  - ✅ Eliminated dual logging system complexity (ADT_CLI_MODE approach)
  - ✅ Unified to use pino consistently with transport-based configuration
  - ✅ Fixed pino-pretty usage according to official documentation
  - ✅ Created shared command utilities to eliminate duplicate code
  - ✅ Fixed OAuth authentication hanging issues
  - ✅ Improved user experience with cleaner output
  - ✅ Created comprehensive specification for logging patterns

- **Browser Opening Fix** - OAuth authentication browser integration ✅ COMPLETED (Sep 16, 2025)
  - ✅ Fixed browser opening issues in container environment
  - ✅ Implemented correct `open` package API usage with `app.name` option
  - ✅ Integrated with Windsurf's BROWSER environment variable
  - ✅ OAuth flow now works seamlessly with automatic browser opening
  - ✅ Authentication system fully functional for ADT operations

### 🔄 In Progress

- **[#5] Reporting Stage** - Comprehensive summary generation (ON HOLD)
  - Dependencies: Transport import (✅ completed), Quality check (✅ completed)
  - Next: Template engine implementation and markdown report generation
  - Status: Paused pending ADT CLI decoupling completion

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers

_None identified_

### Dependencies Status

- ✅ ADT CLI authentication system (available)
- ✅ ADK object adapters (available)
- ✅ OAT format specification (available)
- ❓ ATC API documentation (needs research)

## Daily Progress

### Today's Focus

- ✅ Fixed browser opening issues in OAuth authentication flow
- ✅ Implemented proper `open` package usage with BROWSER env var
- ✅ Validated authentication system functionality
- Project foundation now ready for core pipeline implementation

### Next Session

- Begin Transport Import Stage implementation (#3)

- Set up development environment for testing
- Focus on transport object retrieval and OAT serialization

## Notes

- Following specification-driven development workflow
- All implementations must align with existing specs
- Update GitHub issue labels as progress is made
