# ADT CLI Decoupling Plan

**Created**: 2025-01-09  
**Completed**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Actual Effort**: 1 day

## Overview

This plan outlines the decoupling of the ADT CLI into two separate components:

1. **@abapify/adt-cli** - Command-line interface and orchestration
2. **@abapify/adt-client** - Abstracted ADT connection and service layer

This architectural change follows the specification-driven development approach and implements the architectural decision documented in the memories.

## Objectives

- **Clean Separation**: Decouple CLI orchestration from ADT communication
- **Reusability**: Enable ADT Client usage by other tools and plugins
- **Testability**: Support mocking through abstracted client interface
- **Plugin Simplification**: Plugins receive AdtClient instead of raw connection details
- **Maintainability**: Clearer responsibilities and reduced coupling

## Phase 1: Create ADT Client Package (High Priority)

### 1.1 Package Structure Setup

- [ ] Create `/packages/adt-client/` directory
- [ ] Initialize `package.json` with proper dependencies
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Create directory structure per specification:
  ```
  packages/adt-client/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── client/
  │   │   ├── adt-client.ts
  │   │   ├── connection-manager.ts
  │   │   └── session-manager.ts
  │   ├── services/
  │   │   ├── object-service.ts
  │   │   ├── search-service.ts
  │   │   └── transport-service.ts
  │   ├── types/
  │   │   ├── client.ts
  │   │   ├── objects.ts
  │   │   └── responses.ts
  │   ├── utils/
  │   │   ├── url-builder.ts
  │   │   ├── xml-parser.ts
  │   │   └── error-handler.ts
  │   └── index.ts
  ├── tests/
  └── package.json
  ```

### 1.2 Extract Connection Logic

- [ ] Move `AuthManager` from adt-cli to adt-client
- [ ] Move `auth-utils.ts` and `oauth-utils.ts` to adt-client
- [ ] Extract connection handling from current `ADTClient` class
- [ ] Create `ConnectionManager` for connection pooling and management
- [ ] Create `SessionManager` for session lifecycle and renewal

### 1.3 Implement Core AdtClient Interface

- [ ] Define `AdtClient` interface per specification
- [ ] Implement connection management methods:
  - `connect(config: AdtConnectionConfig): Promise<void>`
  - `disconnect(): Promise<void>`
  - `isConnected(): boolean`
- [ ] Implement low-level request method:
  - `request(endpoint: string, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<Response>`

## Phase 2: Implement Service Layer (High Priority)

### 2.1 Object Service

- [ ] Create `ObjectService` class
- [ ] Implement object operations:
  - `getObject(objectType: string, objectName: string): Promise<AdtObject>`
  - `getObjectSource(objectType: string, objectName: string, include?: string): Promise<string>`
  - `getObjectMetadata(objectType: string, objectName: string): Promise<ObjectMetadata>`
  - `updateObject(objectType: string, objectName: string, content: string): Promise<UpdateResult>`
  - `createObject(objectType: string, objectName: string, content: string): Promise<CreateResult>`
  - `deleteObject(objectType: string, objectName: string): Promise<DeleteResult>`
  - `getObjectStructure(objectType: string, objectName: string): Promise<ObjectStructure>`

### 2.2 Search Service

- [ ] Create `SearchService` class
- [ ] Implement search operations:
  - `searchObjects(query: SearchQuery): Promise<SearchResult[]>`
  - `getPackageContents(packageName: string): Promise<PackageContent>`

### 2.3 Transport Service

- [ ] Create `TransportService` class
- [ ] Implement transport operations:
  - `getTransportObjects(transportId: string): Promise<TransportObject[]>`
  - `assignToTransport(objectKey: string, transportId: string): Promise<AssignResult>`

### 2.4 System Service

- [ ] Create `SystemService` class
- [ ] Implement system operations:
  - `getSystemInfo(): Promise<SystemInfo>`
  - `getSupportedObjectTypes(): Promise<ObjectTypeInfo[]>`

## Phase 3: Update ADT CLI (Medium Priority)

### 3.1 Refactor CLI Core

- [ ] Update `packages/adt-cli/package.json` to depend on `@abapify/adt-client`
- [ ] Remove extracted connection logic from adt-cli
- [ ] Update CLI commands to initialize and use AdtClient
- [ ] Modify command handlers to receive AdtClient instance

### 3.2 Update Commands

- [ ] Update `get.ts` command to use AdtClient
- [ ] Update `search.ts` command to use AdtClient
- [ ] Update `export/package.ts` command to use AdtClient
- [ ] Update `import/transport.ts` command to use AdtClient
- [ ] Update `transport/*` commands to use AdtClient
- [ ] Update `atc.ts` command to use AdtClient

### 3.3 Update Services

- [ ] Refactor `services/export/service.ts` to use AdtClient
- [ ] Refactor `services/import/service.ts` to use AdtClient
- [ ] Refactor `services/search/service.ts` to use AdtClient
- [ ] Refactor `services/transport/service.ts` to use AdtClient
- [ ] Refactor `services/atc/service.ts` to use AdtClient

## Phase 4: Update Plugin Architecture (Medium Priority)

### 4.1 Update Plugin Interfaces

- [ ] Update `ExportObjectParams` interface to include `adtClient: AdtClient`
- [ ] Update `ImportObjectParams` interface to include `adtClient: AdtClient`
- [ ] Remove raw connection details from plugin parameters
- [ ] Update ADK to pass AdtClient to plugins

### 4.2 Update Format Plugins

- [ ] Update abapGit format plugin to use AdtClient
- [ ] Update any other format plugins

### 4.3 Update ADK Bridge

- [ ] Update `adk-object-handler.ts` to use AdtClient
- [ ] Ensure ADK integration works with new architecture

## Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance (Medium Priority)

### 5.1 Create Mock AdtClient

- [ ] Implement `MockAdtClient` interface per specification
- [ ] Create test utilities and factory functions
- [ ] Provide predefined mock responses for common scenarios

### 5.2 Unit Tests

- [ ] Create unit tests for AdtClient core functionality
- [ ] Create unit tests for all service classes
- [ ] Create unit tests for connection and session management
- [ ] Update existing CLI tests to use mock client

### 5.3 Integration Tests

- [ ] Test end-to-end CLI operations with real ADT client

- [ ] Verify backward compatibility of CLI commands

## Phase 6: Documentation and Finalization (Low Priority)

### 6.1 Update Documentation

- [ ] Update README files for both packages
- [ ] Create migration guide for plugin developers
- [ ] Update examples to show new AdtClient usage
- [ ] Document breaking changes and migration path

### 6.2 Build and Deployment

- [ ] Test CLI binary still works after refactoring

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Dependencies

- ADT Client specification (✅ completed)
- Plugin architecture specification (✅ completed)
- Current ADT CLI implementation (✅ available)

### Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility for CLI commands
- Must not break existing plugin interfaces during transition
- Must follow specification-driven development approach
- Must use npm workspaces (not pnpm)

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas

1. **Authentication Flow**: Complex OAuth/SAML handling must be preserved
2. **Session Management**: Connection pooling and session renewal logic
3. **Plugin Compatibility**: Ensure plugins continue to work during transition

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Incremental Migration**: Move functionality piece by piece with thorough testing
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain old interfaces during transition period
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests at each phase
4. **Documentation**: Clear migration guides for plugin developers

## Success Criteria

- [ ] New @abapify/adt-client package successfully created and published
- [ ] ADT CLI refactored to use AdtClient with no functionality loss
- [ ] All existing CLI commands work identically to before
- [ ] Plugin architecture updated to use AdtClient
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for new client package
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture
- [ ] Build and deployment pipeline works for both packages

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days (Package setup and connection extraction)
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 days (Service layer implementation)
- **Phase 3**: 1 day (CLI refactoring)
- **Phase 4**: 0.5 days (Plugin architecture updates)
- **Phase 5**: 1 day (Testing and QA)
- **Phase 6**: 0.5 days (Documentation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 3-5 days
