# ADT CLI Specification

## Overview

The ADT CLI is a platform-agnostic command-line interface that provides end-to-end ABAP development operations through direct integration with SAP ADT (ABAP Development Tools) APIs. It serves as the unified tool for ABAP DevOps workflows, from object serialization to quality reporting.

## Why ADT CLI is Needed

### Problem Statement with Existing Solutions

#### SAP Piper Limitations

**1. Infrastructure Dependency**

- Requires Jenkins infrastructure setup and maintenance
- Tied to specific CI/CD platforms and configurations
- Heavy infrastructure overhead for simple tasks
- Complex deployment and scaling requirements

**2. Fragmented Workflow**

- Multiple separate tools for different tasks
- No unified end-to-end experience
- Complex orchestration between different components
- Inconsistent interfaces across tools

**3. Configuration Complexity**

- Multiple configuration files required (`repositories.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, etc.)
- Complex setup process with many prerequisites
- Steep learning curve for teams
- Difficult to troubleshoot configuration issues

**4. Limited Local Development Support**

- Primarily designed for CI/CD environments
- Difficult to run and test locally
- Poor developer experience for local workflows
- No offline development capabilities

**5. Platform Lock-in**

- Jenkins-specific implementation
- Difficult to migrate to other CI/CD platforms
- Vendor-specific dependencies and limitations

### Business Impact of Current Limitations

- **Reduced Developer Productivity**: Complex setup and fragmented tools slow development cycles
- **High Operational Overhead**: Infrastructure maintenance and configuration management costs
- **Limited Flexibility**: Platform lock-in prevents adoption of modern CI/CD solutions
- **Poor Developer Experience**: Inconsistent local and CI/CD workflows
- **Scalability Issues**: Infrastructure-heavy solutions don't scale efficiently

## ADT CLI Solution Architecture

### Core Design Principles

#### 1. Platform-Agnostic Design

**Universal Compatibility**

- Works with any CI/CD platform (GitLab, GitHub, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, etc.)
- Same commands and behavior across all environments
- No platform-specific dependencies or configurations
- Easy migration between CI/CD platforms

**Local-First Development**

- Full functionality available for local development
- Offline capabilities where possible
- Consistent experience between local and CI/CD environments
- Developer-friendly debugging and troubleshooting

#### 2. End-to-End Unified Experience

**Single Tool Philosophy**

- Complete workflow from serialization to reporting in one CLI
- Unified interface for all ABAP DevOps tasks
- Consistent command structure and options
- Reduced context switching between tools

**Integrated Workflow**

```bash
# Complete transport analysis in single command chain
adt auth login --service-key ./service-key.json
adt import transport TR001 ./output --format oat
adt atc --transport TR001 --format gitlab --output results.json
adt report generate --transport TR001 --template summary
```

#### 3. Transport-Centric Workflow

**Granular Change Focus**

- Transport requests as the primary unit of change
- Delta analysis showing exactly what changed
- Context-aware change reviews
- Business-focused change documentation

**Change Traceability**

- Complete audit trail of transport contents
- Before/after comparison capabilities
- Impact analysis across dependent objects
- Change history and evolution tracking

#### 4. Environment-Aware Intelligence

**Adaptive Output Formatting**

- GitLab Code Quality format for GitLab CI/CD
- GitHub Actions format for GitHub workflows
- SARIF format for security and quality tools
- Human-readable console output for local development

**Context-Sensitive Behavior**

- Automatic detection of CI/CD environment
- Appropriate logging levels and output formats
- Environment-specific optimizations
- Intelligent error handling and reporting

### Technical Architecture

#### Direct ADT API Integration

**Native SAP Integration**

- Direct communication with SAP ADT APIs
- No intermediate layers or proxies
- Authentic SAP authentication and authorization
- Full access to SAP object metadata and operations

**Type-Safe Object Handling**

- Integration with ADK for type-safe ABAP object modeling
- Compile-time validation of object structures
- Consistent object representation across operations
- Extensible object type system

#### Lightweight Self-Contained Design

**Zero Infrastructure Requirements**

- Single executable with no external dependencies
- No server infrastructure to maintain
- No database or persistent storage requirements
- Minimal resource footprint

**Fast Setup and Execution**

- Minutes to get started vs. hours for complex pipelines
- No complex configuration or setup procedures
- Immediate productivity for new team members
- Rapid iteration and testing cycles

## Core Command Categories

### Authentication Commands

```bash
# Service key authentication
adt auth login --service-key ./service-key.json

# Interactive authentication
adt auth login --interactive

# Token-based authentication
adt auth login --token $SAP_TOKEN --endpoint $SAP_ENDPOINT
```

**Design Rationale**: Flexible authentication supporting multiple SAP deployment scenarios (BTP, on-premise, different authentication methods).

### Object Management Commands

```bash
# Import transport contents
adt import transport TR001 ./output --format oat

# Get individual objects
adt get object ZCL_TEST --type class --output ./objects/

# List objects in package
adt list package Z_CUSTOM --recursive
```

**Design Rationale**: Transport-centric operations with support for individual object manipulation when needed.

### Quality Analysis Commands

```bash
# Run ATC checks on transport
adt atc --transport TR001 --format gitlab --output atc-results.json

# Run ATC on specific objects
adt atc --objects ZCL_TEST,ZIF_TEST --format sarif

# Custom rule sets
adt atc --transport TR001 --ruleset custom-rules.xml
```

**Design Rationale**: Comprehensive quality analysis with environment-aware output formatting.

### Reporting Commands

```bash
# Generate transport summary
adt report generate --transport TR001 --template summary

# Custom report templates
adt report generate --transport TR001 --template ./custom-template.md

# Delta analysis report
adt report delta --transport TR001 --baseline TR000
```

**Design Rationale**: Flexible reporting system supporting custom templates and multiple output formats.

## Integration Architecture

### With ADT Client

**Abstracted ADT Communication**

- ADT CLI initializes and manages ADT Client instances
- ADT Client handles all SAP ADT API communication
- Plugins receive initialized ADT Client for operations
- Clean separation between CLI orchestration and ADT communication
- **Specification**: See [ADT Client Specification](../adt-client/README.md)

```typescript
// CLI initializes ADT Client
const adtClient = new AdtClient();
await adtClient.connect(connectionConfig);

// Plugins receive client instance
const plugin = pluginRegistry.getPlugin(format);
await plugin.exportObject({
  objectType: 'CLAS',
  objectName: 'ZCL_EXAMPLE',
  adtClient: adtClient,
  targetPath: './output',
});
```

### With ADK (ABAP Development Kit)

**Type-Safe Object Processing**

- ADK provides type-safe ABAP object specifications
- ADT Client uses ADK adapters for object serialization/parsing
- Compile-time validation of object structures
- Consistent object representation across operations

```typescript
// Bridge pattern integration via ADT Client
class AdkObjectHandler<T extends Spec<unknown, Kind>> {
  constructor(
    private adtClient: AdtClient,
    private parser: (xml: string) => T,
    private objectType: string
  ) {}
}
```

### With OAT Format

**Standardized Object Storage**

- OAT format as the canonical object representation
- Git-friendly project structure
- Consistent metadata storage using ADK specifications
- Version control optimized serialization

### With CI/CD Platforms

**Universal Integration Pattern**

```yaml
# GitLab CI example
abap-quality-check:
  script:
    - adt auth login --service-key $SERVICE_KEY
    - adt atc --transport $TRANSPORT_ID --format gitlab --output gl-code-quality-report.json
  artifacts:
    reports:
      codequality: gl-code-quality-report.json
```

**Environment Detection**

- Automatic CI/CD platform detection
- Appropriate output formatting and logging
- Environment-specific optimizations
- Seamless integration without configuration
