# Project Planning Structure

This directory contains local project planning files that complement GitHub Issues and Projects. These files provide detailed planning, progress tracking, and coordination that can be read and updated by AI assistants.

## File Structure

- `abap-code-review.md` - Main project plan for ABAP Code Review CI/CD Pipeline
- `current-sprint.md` - Current development focus and active tasks
- `roadmap.md` - High-level project roadmap and milestones
- `technical-debt.md` - Technical debt tracking and prioritization

## Integration with GitHub

- **GitHub Issues**: External visibility, collaboration, and discussion
- **Local Planning**: Detailed implementation planning, progress tracking, AI coordination
- **Sync Strategy**: GitHub issue numbers referenced in local plans, status updates flow both ways

## AI Assistant Usage

These files are designed to be read and updated by AI assistants to:

- Track detailed progress within tasks
- Coordinate implementation steps
- Maintain context across development sessions
- Provide visibility into current status and next steps
